<h1>ML Enhanced Recruitment Model</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
For accounting firms looking to guarantee accurate finances and comprehensive reporting, hiring qualified personnel is essential. However, considering the specialist knowledge needed, evaluating applicants for senior accounting positions might be difficult. Using machine learning techniques, this employment process might be made more efficient and automated.
</p>
<p>
This project intends to create a model that will find applicants for senior accounting positions who meet the requirements for a given region based on their degree, experience, and desired remuneration. A dataset containing information on over 300 senior accountants, including their location, years of experience, education level, subject expertise, and goal income percentiles, will be used to train the model. Essential skills from text job descriptions will be extracted by natural language processing. Both the pay requirement and candidate eligibility will be predicted by the trained classifier.
</p>
<p>
Firms could identify the top applicants for open senior accountant positions across the globe with the use of an accurate model. Recruiting managers might quickly screen candidates based on their compensation expectations and skill set for the position. This would improve candidate quality, save hiring costs, and increase recruiting efficiency. The project offers a great deal of potential to improve accounting-related hiring.
</p>
<p>
The goal of streamlining and updating the conventional hiring procedure is what drove the creation of a Machine Learning (ML) Enhanced Recruitment Model. Machine learning algorithms can greatly increase the effectiveness of applicant selection, shorten the time it takes to make a hire, and improve the general quality of hires thanks to the abundance of data that is available. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be used to automate resume screening, which can speed up the process of finding qualified candidates. Additionally, by spotting trends and preferences that result in placements that go well, machine learning models that are based on hiring data from the past can help to improve the candidate matching process. Crucially, the model's capacity to reduce biases in hiring procedures is consistent with the goal of equitable and inclusive employment practices. These models, which make use of predictive analytics, give hiring managers and recruiters data-driven decision-making abilities by offering insights into trends, candidate habits, and the efficacy of different recruitment tactics. Previous work in this area has included applicant experience and diversity initiatives, resume parsing, keyword matching, predictive analytics, and more. These efforts have all contributed to the continuous advancement of ML-enhanced recruitment tactics.

<strong>Potential questions:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Which educational background and skill sets most closely indicate a senior accountant's qualifications for a given position?</li>
<li>Does a strong correlation exist between years of experience and increased compensation expectations?</li>
<li>What are the main regional variations in senior accountant salary and skill requirements?</li>
<li>To what extent can the skills and experience of a candidate be used to determine the requisite wage percentiles?</li>
<li>What is the optimal architecture for a machine learning model in this multimodal classification problem?</li>
<li>What effects does feature selection have on training time and model accuracy?</li>
<li>Is it possible for the model to find qualified applicants in the absence of labeled wage percentile data?</li>
<li>What is the model's generalization ability to previously unknown candidate profiles?</li>
<li>What dashboards or interfaces may recruiters use to take advantage of model predictions?</li>
<li>How can the model be trained again over time when the accounting industry's skill requirements change?</li>

<h2>Data Prep & EDA</h2>
<p> A web-scraped wage dataset gathered from https://www.salary.com/research/jobs and a simulated accountant dataset are loaded by the code. It merges them together to create a single dataset named as combined_data. Further, it removes missing data by substituting NaN values for empty strings and zeros, and then removing rows containing any NaN values. It also transforms column data types into suitable data types, such as texts, integers, etc. This gets a merged, clean dataset ready for examination.

<h2>Data Visualization</h2>

<p>1. Salary Percentiles Distribution</p>

<img src="images/Unknown-10.jpeg" alt="Project Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
<p>In the combined_data DataFrame, you can rapidly evaluate the central tendency, spread, and existence of outliers in the salary percentiles across several columns by using above boxplot.</p>

<p>2. Pairplot of Skillset Scores</p>

<img src="images/Unknown.jpeg" alt="Project Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
<p>The correlations and distributions between skillset scores in the combined_data DataFrame are shown in the pairplot above. The link between two skillset scores is depicted in each scatterplot in the pairplot matrix, and the super title serves as the overall title for the whole display.</p>

<p>3. Histogram of Median Salary</p>

<img src="images/Unknown-2.jpeg" alt="Project Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
<p>The distribution of median salary in the combined_data DataFrame ('Percentile50' column) is shown by the above histogram. The kernel density estimate plot presents a smoothed picture of the underlying distribution, while the histogram sheds light on the frequency or count of various income ranges. The plot's content can be understood with the aid of the title and axis labels.</p>

<p>4. Number of Job Postings by Education Level</p>

<img src="images/Unknown-3.jpeg" alt="Project Image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
<p>The distribution of job listings in the combined_data DataFrame according to various educational levels is seen in the above count graphic. A brief summary of the quantity of job ads linked to each educational level is given by the graphic. The y-axis shows the number of job listings for each category, and the x-axis labels show the distinct education levels. The caption provides context for the plot.</p>
